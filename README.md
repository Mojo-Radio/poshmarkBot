Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/imparikh/poshmarkBot.git
```
run the following command to install robobrowser:
```

```

Open the userInfo.txt and replace that info with your username and password for poshmark.

Then run:
```

```

##Use
Once you run it, the following message comes up:
```
What would you like to search for? Separate your search queries with spaces: 
```
Then type in as many search queries as you want, separated by spaces. Then just let it go.

This imitates a human by waiting for some time in between each follow and return. Hey, at least you don't have to wait?
